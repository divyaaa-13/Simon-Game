The Simon Game is a classic memory game where players must remember and replicate increasingly complex sequences of lights and sounds. The game consists of four colored buttons, each producing a distinct tone when pressed. The game starts with one random button lighting up and playing its tone. The player must then press the same button. With each successful round, the game adds another random button to the sequence, and the player must remember and reproduce the entire sequence in the correct order. The game continues until the player makes a mistake or successfully completes all the rounds.


## Features

- Interactive Gameplay: The game provides an engaging experience by challenging the player's memory and concentration.
- Increasing Difficulty: With each round, the sequence length increases, making the game progressively harder.
- Visual and Audio Cues: Each button produces a unique tone and lights up, aiding the player in memorizing the sequence.
- Responsive Design: The game is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a smooth user experience across different platforms.
